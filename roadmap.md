# Fundamentals Roadmap 

## What is this?
When I tell people they could be making 50-60k a year as junior web developer with less than a year of self-taught training, I'm often asked how to start.  I've been in this career for approximately 25 years. Having interviewed hundreds of developers and trained dozens from junior level to mid/senior level, I know what works and what employers are looking for.  This is a rodmap of what I would recommend for someone starting off with no prior development knowledge.  

## First Steps
You are going to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript first.  These are fundamental and necessary for all web developers to understand and how to use.  I've linked 3 courses that are free on YouTube from one of my favorite instructors.

### HTML

### CSS

### JavaScript
Start with pure JavaScript. Also referred to as vanilla or plain JavaScript.

For now, avoid jQuery or any other JavaScript libraries and frameworks

## Next Steps
There are two technology stacks that I'd recommend: [Microsoft .NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework) or [React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library).  Both are in extremely high demand and the pay is good. Take a look at the jobs available right now for both specialties: 
* [React Remote Jobs](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=react&l=remote)
* [.Net Remote Jobs](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=asp%20.net&l=remote)

These job listings change daily, but I'm confident you will see plenty of listing offering 100k-200k+ salaries when you look. 

After you've completed the HTML, CSS, JavaScript training, I'd watch some tutorials on .NET and React to see which style you are more interested.  Do a basics tutorial for each and see which one you wanted to be working with, then stick with that one.  Do not try to learn both this early on.  You get paid a lot more being an expert in one of these specialties than knowing a little about both.

### Tools
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - This is what you will be writing you code in

For starting off, I recommend using a cloud based IDE. This makes it easier to share your projects with others so you can get help when you run into issues

I'd start with [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) - It's free and probably has the most intutive layout for working with the fundamentals of HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Many tutorials will recommend an installable IDE, usually [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  If you don't want to waste the time setting this up, you should be able to complete any of the tutorials using a cloud IDE like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
