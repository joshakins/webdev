For now, avoid jQuery or any other JavaScript libraries and frameworks

### Tools
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - This is what you will be writing you code in

For starting off, I recommend using a cloud based IDE. This makes it easier to share your projects with others so you can get help when you run into issues

I'd start with [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) - It's free and probably has the most intutive layout for working with the fundamentals of HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Many tutorials will recommend an installable IDE, usually [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  If you don't want to waste the time setting this up, you should be able to complete any of the tutorials using a cloud IDE like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
